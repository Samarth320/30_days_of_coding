There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

1.The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
2.The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array

These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

Example

input arrays

array1 --> [2, 4]
array2 --> [16, 32, 96]

output
3

in the range 4 to 16 , 4, 8 and 16 are the only three numbers for which each element of array1 is a factor of these numbers and each of these numbers are factor of all elements of array2.
